## Examples

#### Variant 1

This variant seems to be used by American Airlines [AA] and US Airways 

```
OS KPHX /CLR
```
```
OS KSFO /IR KSFO0312
```

```

```

```
OS KAUS /ALT00001521
```

A reference at [ACARS Online](http://acarsonline.pbworks.com/w/page/1286731/Message%20Labels)
states that message above indicates the 
aircraft is approaching KAUS, the altimeter at KAUS is set to "0000", and the flight is expected to arrive
at 1521 UTC. (This may be a dated description and the altimeter portion of the value may be obsolete.)

#### Variant 2

This variant appears to be used mainly by United Airlines [UA].

of arrival, the third field appears to be the local day of month, the fourth field is the time in UTC, and
the fifth field is the flight number.

## Analysis

There appears to be at least 4 variants of message text for label `5Z` in the US alone.
This is to be expected, since `5Z` is known as the `Airline Designated Downlink`.
