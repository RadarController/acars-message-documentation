## Analysis



### Example 1:
KORD - Departure airport (Chicago ORD)

ESSA - Arrival airport (Stockholm ARN)

CYYB, CYVO and CYBG - These appear to be alternates?

## Example 2
GCFV - Departure airport (Fuerteventura FUE)

EGCC - Arrival airport (Manchester MAN)

## Example 3
EGGW - Destination airport (London Luton LTN)

EGSS - Alternate (London Stansted STN)

EGNX - Secondary alternate? (East Midlands EMA)

Message was sent approx. 45mins from arrival into Luton, so I am assuming it is requesting weather for all 3 airports

## Example 4
EIDW - Destination airport

## Example 5
Sent exactly 15 minutes after departure from KMCO, appears to be requesting weather data for Tampa (KTPA), Miami (KMIA) and Fort Lauderdale (KFLL). Second message begins with MPTO, the planned destination and MPPA appears to be the planned alternate

## Example 6
This flight actually ended up diverting to San Antonio KSAN, was scheduled for Dallas KDFW. This message was sent immediately after exiting a hold prior to arrival into DFW.

KOKC appears to be the planned diversion

## Example 7
Flight from KDFW to KMFE

Mesage was sent almost exactly 15 minutes after takeoff from KDFW
