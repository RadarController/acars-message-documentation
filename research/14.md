## Analysis
There appears to be three variants of label 14 messages: one primarily used by business jets, one primarily used by Frontier Airlines, and one primarily used by United Airlines.

#### Variant 1 (BizJets)
Messages that start with `(2` preamble should end with `(Z` to indicate message is complete. Messages that do not have `(Z` generally indicate that they are one of several pieces of a bigger reassembled, and should be ignored (or used in reassembly).

#### Variant 2 (Frontier Airlines)
Comma-separated message format that may contain freetext messages (lines delimited by commas).

```
6,,,Y,N,Y,KMCO,013006,5291,GOOD EVENING ORLANDO,SEE YOU IN ABOUT AN,HOUR AND TWENTY,THANKS...,
```

In this example, `KMCO` is the destination airport. `013006` seems to be the estimated time of arrival in UTC time (01:30:06Z).

#### Variant 3 (United Airlines)
Message appears to capture `OFF` events within the OOOI cycle.

```
/14 OFF EVENT      / KSAN KEWR 07 020624/TIME 0206\r\n/AU 22518324/AON 22347321/AIN 22406321/AOT 22514323
```
In this particular example, `KSAN` is the presumed departing airport and `KEWR` is the presumed arrival airport<sup>1</sup>. The OFF event occurred at 02:06:24Z (02:06Z).

<sup>1</sup> The departing and arrival airport requires configuration from flight crew. In this example, KSAN-KEWR is actually the previous leg of the flight. According to external sources, this flight took off from KEWR and was headed to KATL.
