## Analysis

This appears to be nothing more than the aircraft position. In the last example, the `-53` is the outside air temperature in °C. This also may appear as `M53`.

Records from ADSB Exchange show this aircraft was at 38,100 feet passing over this location at the time
the message was recorded.

Reference message 807671733. Format appears to be:
120925 = UTC time in hhmmss
9991 = altitude in feet, accurate to ADS-B track data
1219 = unknown
94 = unknown
N 53.863 W 2.253 = position to three decimal places, slightly off position compared to ADS-B track data
