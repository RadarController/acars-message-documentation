## Analysis

```
06234L KJFK KATL7
```
First 6 characters seem to be broken down into 2 character fields:

Offset | Value | Meaning
------ | ----- | -------
`+00`  | `06`  | Day of the month (e.g. for Aug 16, 2022 the value would be `16`)
`+02`  | `23`  | Hour of the day
`+04`  | `4L`  | Message label

The next 3 fields are populated by the origin airport ICAO code, destination airport ICAO code, and the number `7`.
I'm not sure why it is `7` but all my example instances (~291 entries) have the value `7`.

```
/FN 0684
```
The second line describes the flight number for the leg.

```
/ENG 1 RUN 224600/ENG 2 RUN 225829
```
The third line has what I believe to be the start timestamp of each of the two engines. 
In this example, engine 1 started its "run" at 22:46:00 and engine 2 started its "run" at 22:58:29.
