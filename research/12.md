## Description

Label 12 usage has only been observed with Spirit Airlines (NK) to date.

Please provide examples of any other air carriers making use of this label.

## Examples

### Example from flight NK0542, registration N617NK, ICAO A809F5.
Recorded Tuesday, July 5, 2022 19:54:14 UTC

```
POSN 295754W 953809,-------,1954, 314,,  23,17788  11,FOB   90,ETA 2000,MMUN,KIAH,
```

The first field after POS is the location, given as latitude and logitude:
*** N 295754
*** W 953809

The third field appears to be the time in UTC.

*** The eighth field says "FOB   90".  In some contextx, FOB means "fuel on board", but it is not clear that is the meaning here.
*** The ninth field appears to be the expected time of arrival in UTC "ETA 2000".
*** The tenth field is the airport of departure (MMUN = Cancun, Mexico).
*** The eleventh field is the airport of arrival (KIAH = Houston Intercontinental, Texas, USA).

### Example from flight NK0523, registration N512NK, ICAO A66A13
Recorded Wednesday, July 6, 2022 23:21:22 UTC

```
POSN 300018W 953852,-------,2321, 318,,  23,17365   8,FOB   80,ETA 2326,MHLM,KIAH,
```

This example is very similar to the first example.

### Example from flight NK1199, registration N604NK, ICAO A7D751
Recorded Thursday, July 7, 2022 11:39:39 UTC

```
POSN 295743W 953932,-------,1139,1040,,   8,15992   9,FOB  208,ETA 1409,KIAH,KLAS,
```

This was recorded shortly after takeoff, and so the ETA (field 9) is several hours later than the time the message was recorded.
